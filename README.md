This is the main repository that is needed for project one. 

## Repositories that will be created and used for projects

CMPG-323-Overview will be the main repository. It will have links to all the other repositories that will be made for the other projects.

As stated earlier each projects repository will have links in the CMPG-323-Overview repository and in all of the projects repositories, they will have links to any other repositories or projects that are created and used.

## Branching strategy that will be used within each project

The branching strategy that I will use for each of my projects will be the GitHub Flow strategy. 
The strategy works by keeping a continuously deployable main branch. A feature branch is created to work on any feature or bug fix. Each feature branch must be finished and fully tested before being merged with the main branch.

## Explain the use of a .gitignore file within each project

In each project I will use a .gitignore file to ignore System-specific files, vscode workspace and security key files and API keys.

## Explain the storage of credentials and sensitive information

Credentials and sensitive information will be stored in a .gitignore file. So they will not be added to the repository when committing changes to a branch.
